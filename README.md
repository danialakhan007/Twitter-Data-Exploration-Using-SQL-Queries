Welcome to the Twitter Data Exploration project! This repository is dedicated to the initial exploration of Twitter data using SQL queries. The dataset, conveniently stored in .csv files, encompasses three key tables: Tweets, Users, and Followers. Here's a brief overview of what you'll find in this repository:

Dataset Overview:

Tweets Table: Contains user_id, tweet timestamp, and tweet text.
Users Table: Includes user_id, username, and user age.
Followers Table: Consists of user_id and follower_id pairs.
Objective:
The primary goal of this project is to gain insights into the Twitter data through SQL queries. These queries delve into various aspects, such as tweet count by age group, average number of followers by age group, top hashtags used by younger users, and the tendency of users to follow others in their same age group.
